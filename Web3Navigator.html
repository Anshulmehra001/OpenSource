            <h2>The Guiding Principles of Web3</h2>
            <p>Web3 is more than just a new technology; it's a philosophical shift in how we think about the internet. It's built on a foundation of core principles that stand in contrast to the centralized model of Web2 (the internet of today).</p>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Decentralization</h4>
                    <p>Instead of data and applications living on servers owned by a single company (like Google or Meta), they run on a distributed network of computers. This eliminates single points of failure and control, making the system more resilient and censorship-resistant.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Trustlessness & Verifiability</h4>
                    <p>You don't need to trust a central authority or intermediary to ensure that a transaction is valid. The network's code and consensus mechanism are designed to be self-governing. Anyone can publicly verify transactions on the blockchain, creating a transparent system.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>Immutability & Provenance</h4>
                    <p>Once data is recorded on a blockchain, it is extremely difficult and computationally expensive to alter or delete it. This creates a permanent, unchangeable record of history. This is critical for proving ownership (provenance) of digital assets.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h4>User Ownership & Control</h4>
                    <p>In Web3, you control your own data and digital assets through your cryptographic wallet. You don't need permission from a platform to use your assets, and they can't be taken from you without your private keys. This is often summarized as "read, write, own."</p>

    <!-- ========================== CORE CONCEPTS SECTION ========================== -->
    <section id="concepts" class="page-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>The Building Blocks of Web3</h2>
            <p>To understand Web3, you must first grasp the foundational technologies that make it possible.</p>
            <h3>1. What is a Blockchain?</h3>
            <p>A blockchain is a special type of database, often described as a **distributed, immutable digital ledger**. Let's break that down:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ledger:</strong> It's a record book of transactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital:</strong> It exists on computers.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Instead of one person holding the book, thousands of copies are spread across a network of computers (nodes). Everyone has the same version.</li>
                <li><strong>Immutable:</strong> It's incredibly difficult to change past records. This is achieved through cryptography.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How it Works: Blocks & Chains</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Transactions are grouped together into a "block".</li>
                <li>Each block contains a cryptographic "hash" (a unique fingerprint) of the previous block.</li>
                <li>This hash links the new block to the previous one, creating a "chain".</li>
                <li>If someone tries to alter an old block, its hash will change. This breaks the link to all subsequent blocks, and the rest of the network will immediately reject the change.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>2. Consensus Mechanisms: How Nodes Agree</h3>
            <p>Since the ledger is distributed, all the nodes need a way to agree on which new blocks are valid. This is called a consensus mechanism.</p>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card"><h4>Proof-of-Work (PoW)</h4><p>Used by Bitcoin and currently by Ethereum. "Miners" use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first one to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block and is rewarded with cryptocurrency. This process is very secure but consumes a massive amount of energy.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</h4><p>Used by chains like Solana, Cardano, and Ethereum's upcoming version. "Validators" lock up (or "stake") their own cryptocurrency as collateral. The network randomly selects a validator to propose the next block. If they act dishonestly, they can lose their staked coins. PoS is vastly more energy-efficient than PoW.</p></div>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Smart Contracts: The "Backend" of Web3</h3>
            <p>A smart contract is a program that runs on the blockchain. It's a self-executing agreement where the terms are written directly into code. Once deployed, it runs automatically when certain conditions are met, and its execution is enforced by the blockchain network.</p>
            <div class="info-box"><strong>Analogy:</strong> Think of a smart contract like a vending machine. You put in money (a transaction), the machine automatically verifies the amount, and then it dispenses your snack (executes the contract's function). There's no need for a human intermediary.</div>

            <h3>4. DApps, DeFi, and NFTs: The Applications</h3>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card"><h4>DApps (Decentralized Applications)</h4><p>Applications whose backend logic runs on smart contracts instead of a centralized server. The frontend can still be a normal website, but it interacts with the blockchain.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>DeFi (Decentralized Finance)</h4><p>An ecosystem of financial DApps built on blockchain. It aims to recreate traditional financial systems (like lending, borrowing, and exchanges) without central intermediaries. Example: Uniswap.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)</h4><p>Unique cryptographic tokens that represent ownership of a specific digital or physical asset. "Non-fungible" means each one is unique and cannot be replaced by another. Used for digital art, collectibles, gaming items, and more.</p></div>
            </div>

            <h3>5. Layer 1 vs. Layer 2: Scaling the Blockchain</h3>
            <p>As blockchains like Ethereum become popular, they get congested and expensive. Scaling solutions have emerged to address this.</p>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card"><h4>Layer 1 (L1)</h4><p>The base blockchain itself (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana). Improving an L1's speed is difficult and can compromise security or decentralization (The Blockchain Trilemma).</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>Layer 2 (L2)</h4><p>A separate protocol built "on top" of a Layer 1 to increase transaction speed and reduce costs. L2s process transactions off-chain and then "roll up" a summary of them to post to the main L1 chain, inheriting its security. Examples: Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism.</p></div>

            <h2>Practical Web3 Tutorials</h2>
            <div class="warning-box"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> These tutorials involve creating a crypto wallet. While we will primarily use test networks with no real money, the skills you learn apply to real assets. <strong>Never share your Secret Recovery Phrase (Seed Phrase) with anyone. Write it down and store it securely offline.</strong></div>

            <h3>Tutorial 1: Setting Up a MetaMask Wallet</h3>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To create your first self-custody crypto wallet, your passport to the Web3 world.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Installation:</strong> Go to the official <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">MetaMask website</a> and install the browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Brave.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a Wallet:</strong> Open the extension and click "Create a new wallet". Agree to the terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Create a Password:</strong> This password only protects the extension on your local device. It is NOT your main key.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Your Wallet (CRITICAL STEP):</strong> MetaMask will now reveal your 12-word **Secret Recovery Phrase**. This is the master key to your wallet.
                    <ul><li><strong>DO:</strong> Write these words down on a piece of paper in the correct order. Store this paper in a secure, private, physical location.</li><li><strong>DO NOT:</strong> Store it as a text file on your computer, take a screenshot of it, or save it in a password manager. If your device is compromised, your funds will be stolen.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Confirm:</strong> The app will ask you to confirm your phrase by re-entering it. Once done, your wallet is ready!</li>
            </ol>

            <hr>
            <h3>Tutorial 2: Using a Testnet & Getting Test ETH</h3>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To switch to a test network and get free, valueless Ether to use for testing DApps.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Show Test Networks:</strong> In MetaMask, click the network dropdown at the top left (it will likely say "Ethereum Mainnet"). Click "Show/hide test networks" and toggle it ON.</li>
                <li><strong>Switch to Sepolia:</strong> Select the "Sepolia" test network from the dropdown. Your balance will show 0 ETH.</li>
                <li><strong>Get Your Address:</strong> Click on your account name to copy your wallet address (it starts with <code>0x...</code>).</li>
                <li><strong>Use a Faucet:</strong> Go to a Sepolia Faucet website (e.g., <a href="https://sepoliafaucet.com/" target="_blank">sepoliafaucet.com</a> or <a href="https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia" target="_blank">Infura's faucet</a>). You may need to create a free account. Paste your wallet address and request test ETH.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Balance:</strong> After a minute or two, your MetaMask wallet on the Sepolia network should show a balance (e.g., 0.5 Sepolia ETH). This ETH has no real-world value.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr>
            <h3>Tutorial 3: Your First Smart Contract with Remix</h3>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To write and deploy a simple "Counter" smart contract without any local setup.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Open Remix:</strong> Go to the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Remix Project IDE</a> in your browser. It's a full development environment for Solidity (the main language for Ethereum smart contracts).</li>
                <li><strong>Create a New File:</strong> In the file explorer on the left, create a new file named <code>Counter.sol</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Write the Code:</strong> Paste the following code into the file. Read the comments to understand what each line does.
<pre><code>// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

                <li><strong>Compile the Contract:</strong> Go to the "Solidity Compiler" tab on the left (second icon). Make sure the compiler version matches the one in the code (e.g., 0.8.18). Click "Compile Counter.sol". A green checkmark will appear if successful.</li>
                <li><strong>Deploy the Contract:</strong> Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab (third icon).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Under "ENVIRONMENT", select "Injected Provider - MetaMask". Remix will prompt you to connect your wallet. Approve it.</li>
                        <li>Ensure your MetaMask is still on the Sepolia testnet.</li>
                        <li>Click the orange "Deploy" button. MetaMask will pop up asking you to confirm the transaction (this will use your test ETH). Confirm it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Interact with Your Contract:</strong> Once the transaction is confirmed, your deployed contract will appear at the bottom of the Remix panel. You'll see buttons for `increment`, `decrement`, and `counter`.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Click the blue `counter` button. It will instantly return `0`. (This is a "read" operation, so it's free).</li>
                        <li>Click the orange `increment` button. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask. Wait for it to complete.</li>
                        <li>Now click `counter` again. It will return `1`. Congratulations, you've successfully deployed and interacted with a smart contract on a live test network!</li>

            <h2>The Web3 Developer Stack</h2>
            <p>Building a DApp requires a new set of tools compared to traditional web development.</p>
            <h3>Core Components</h3>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card"><h4>Smart Contract Language</h4><p><b>Solidity:</b> The most popular language for EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.). Statically typed and curly-braced, similar to C++ or JavaScript. <b>Rust:</b> Used for high-performance chains like Solana and Polkadot.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>Development Environment</h4><p><b>Hardhat:</b> A flexible JavaScript-based environment for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts. Features a built-in local blockchain for rapid testing. <b>Truffle:</b> Another popular development suite with a long history in the space.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>Frontend Library</h4><p><b>Ethers.js / Web3.js:</b> JavaScript libraries that allow your frontend (e.g., a React app) to communicate with the blockchain. They handle connecting to wallets, calling smart contract functions, and listening for events.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>Node Provider</h4><p><b>Infura / Alchemy:</b> To talk to the blockchain, your DApp needs to connect to a node. These services provide reliable, high-availability access to blockchain nodes without you needing to run your own, which is resource-intensive.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>Decentralized Storage</h4><p><b>IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):</b> A peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed way. Instead of location-based addressing (like a URL), it uses content-based addressing (a hash of the content). Used for storing NFT metadata and DApp frontends.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>Oracles</h4><p><b>Chainlink:</b> Blockchains cannot access real-world data (like stock prices or weather information) on their own. An oracle is a service that provides this off-chain data to smart contracts in a secure and reliable way.</p></div>
            </div>

            <h2>Risks & Challenges in Web3</h2>
            <p>While powerful, the Web3 space is new and comes with significant risks. Acknowledging them is part of a responsible education.</p>
            <div class="warning-box"><strong>Personal Responsibility is Paramount:</strong> In Web3, you are your own bank and your own security guard. There is often no central authority to appeal to if something goes wrong.</div>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card"><h4>Smart Contract Vulnerabilities</h4><p>A bug in a smart contract's code can be exploited to drain funds, and because of immutability, it often cannot be fixed after deployment. Professional audits are crucial but not foolproof. The famous DAO hack of 2016 is a prime example.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>Scams & Phishing</h4><p>The space is rife with scams. Phishing attacks trick users into signing malicious transactions or revealing their seed phrase. Malicious "airdrops" and NFT mints can drain your wallet. <b>Rule: Never type your seed phrase anywhere except when recovering your wallet. Never sign a transaction you don't understand.</b></p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>Market Volatility</h4><p>The value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs can be extremely volatile. Prices can swing dramatically in short periods. Never invest more than you are willing to lose.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><h4>The Blockchain Trilemma</h4><p>A widely discussed challenge in blockchain design, which states that it is difficult for a blockchain to have all three of the following properties simultaneously: <b>Scalability</b> (high transaction throughput), <b>Security</b> (resistance to attack), and <b>Decentralization</b> (no central control). Often, chains have to make trade-offs.</p></div>
